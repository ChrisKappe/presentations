### Setting the stage<br />Infoma newsystem and TFS

- **Infoma newsystem**: 
- *Vertical solution* for *public sector* (cities / municipalities / districts in Germany and Austria) and *churches*: Finance, taxes, facility management, public institutions, document oriented workflow, e-Payment and more
  - Sister company Axians IT&T with a very similar business in Switzerland
- *&gt;1.200* customers on the *same code base* (from current to about 12 months old release), currently on *NAV 2017 moving to Business Central*
  - Approx. 75% through partners (data centers) and 25% as direct customers
- Infoma also offers *introduction and implementation, operations support and individualization*
  - *Separation* of product development and individual customization projects was very important
  - After trying some other setups, bringing together pm, dev and backoffice support for *specific application areas in one unit* works well
- Customers download and (automatically) *self-install new releases*
  - Next step probably will be to offer this as a *WebService*
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Setting the stage<br />Infoma newsystem and TFS

- **Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS):**
- Supports full *Application Lifecycle Management*: from idea to monitored solution in production
- We’ll cover *plan*, *code*, *build*, *test* and *release* in TFS 2018, most in C/AL or AL based areas
- *Scrum-based* development methodology
  - Others are possible as well
  - A lot of configurability and extendability including a big marketplace
- Runs *On-Prem at Infoma* (even deeper extendability), also available as cloud-based SaaS offering *Azure DevOps* (formerly Visual Studio Team Services)
  - Quite similar to Business Central OnPrem vs. Business Central Cloud at the moment
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Setting the stage<br />Main goals for Axians Infoma

- *One source of "truth"* with *all relevant current information* and as few context changes as possible
- *Minimize manual and/or repetitive tasks* for development, product management and release management
  - Handling a lot of releases per year (every 4-6 weeks) is not reasonably manageable otherwise
  - Automate creation of tasks, test cases, documentation; closing tasks, related issues, ...
- *Maximize release quality*
  - One of the base pillars of software development: A bug found before delivery to the customer costs *only a fraction* of a bug found at the customer &rarr; *fail fast, fail early*
  - *Continuously updated* test environments
  - *Self-service* creation of test environments
  - *Automated testing* is work in progress, e.g. migration to BC OnPrem already profits
- *Full traceability* from bug report / feature request through code and test to build and release &rarr; AL
- Good balance between *data security* (GDPR) and *as little friction as possible* during the full development process

## Agenda

- Setting the stage: *Overview Infoma newsystem and TFS*
- **Part one: From customer request to bug / user story**
- Part two: *Release planning and development in TFS*
- Part three: *Continuous integration and quality assurance*
- Part four: *Full traceability* and *release pipelines*
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Part one<br />From customer request to bug / user story

- Customer enters "ticket": *bug report* or *request for new feature* (web interface based on IBM Notes)
- If 1st level support classifies this as actual bug (usually by creating a working repo on an internal or the customers’s database &rarr; tool for db management) or feature request, a *linked WorkItem (UserStory or Bug) in TFS* is generated
  - *When a release is published*, all support tickets that were closed are automatically closed as well &rarr; earlier leads to *frustration* for the customer ("You tell me it is done, now give me the release")
- Bugs get *classified and prioritized*, feature requests with only middle to long term chances of being done are shown in *voting platform* somewhat similar to UserVoice
  - Finished proposals are also only closed *when the release is published*
- Both tickets and proposals for voting are visible directly integrated in TFS &rarr; no context switching
  - *Time recording* is integrated as well through a WebService call to our NAV-based ERP
- *Legal requiremens* and *internally planned new features* are also classified and prioritized
- Centralized *dashboard for open issues* in various stages with short and long term goals

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Part two<br />Release planning and development in TFS

- Different WorkItem paths according to teams size but mainly *inbox – discussion – waiting for concept – planning done – prepared for development – development* (in Scrum sprints with retro, planning etc.)
  - Sometimes for a couple of weeks we adopt a more *Kanban like style* with the goal of fixing *as many issues as possible with the least possible overhead* &rarr; works better with more experienced developers
- Release planning through *prioritization* (backlog grooming) and field *"planned release"*, but broad topics in Office as TFS didn’t work so well for us in that area 
  - We are not using Epics and Features as mainly intended in TFS...
- Development consists of "doing", "crosstest and code review" and "transfer to release db"
  - Very much looking forward to (Git or TFVC) *pull requests* for our main solution
  - Small tool for *transfering C/AL objects* to the release database with two- or three-way diff
- PM tests as much as possible *during sprints* &rarr; how much is possible depends on the overall workload

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Part three<br />Continuous integration and quality assurance

- Every night *automated build of a full release* – same as for actual release
  - Again: *fail fast, fail early*
  - No "related changes" yet as we are not using integrated source control for our main solution, but for our AL extension
- *Automated deployment of changed objects* to test databases (no full install yet) and *auto-tests*
  - Enables product managers to *test with good data* (even some customer databases who agreed to let us test with their data) while development is still working &rarr; if possible, *don't wait for release tests*
- Test cases for *every* closed WorkItem
  - Make sure you *test everything at least once*, no matter how small
- *Automatically generated PDF documentation* from content in WorkItems
  - Release notes for major releases usually with up to 150 pages or more, which gets ugly in Word
- After release: Docker-based *self-service version environments* for "did this work in release X and break in releas Y?" tests including the correct NAV CUs
- *Beta workshops* with selected customers and partners together with product managers

### Part four<br />Full traceability and release pipelines

- Small *AL Extension* (Entry Search and Find with phonetic search) published in AppSource
- *Code and WorkItems* in TFS
- Setup of Team Foundation Version Control as alternative backend for source control in Visual Studio Code
- *Automated build and test* on every code change and nightly
- No publish as we don't run customer environments
  - Will show you the *release pipeline for one of our internal tools* in TFS
